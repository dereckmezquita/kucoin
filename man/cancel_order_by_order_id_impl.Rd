\usage{
cancel_order_by_order_id_impl(
  keys = get_api_keys(),
  base_url = get_base_url(),
  orderId,
  symbol,
  .__coro_env_parent__ = <environment>
)
}
\arguments{
\item{keys}{List; API configuration parameters from \code{get_api_keys()}. Defaults to \code{get_api_keys()}.}

\item{base_url}{Character string; base URL for the KuCoin API. Defaults to \code{get_base_url()}.}

\item{orderId}{Character string; the unique order ID to cancel. Required.}

\item{symbol}{Character string; the trading pair symbol (e.g., "BTC-USDT"). Required.}
}
\value{
Promise resolving to a \code{data.table} containing:
\itemize{
\item \code{orderId} (character): The order ID that was requested to be cancelled.
}
}
\description{
Cancels a spot order by its order ID on the KuCoin Spot trading system asynchronously.
This function sends a cancellation request and returns the order ID if the request is successfully sent.
Note that the actual cancellation status must be checked via order status or Websocket subscription.
}
\details{
\subsection{Difference Between Cancel By OrderId and Cancel By ClientOid}{
\itemize{
\item \strong{Cancel By OrderId}: Use this when you have the unique order ID generated by KuCoin. This is useful if you are tracking orders using KuCoin's identifiers.
\item \strong{Cancel By ClientOid}: Use this when you have assigned a unique client order ID (clientOid) to your orders. This is convenient if you are tracking orders using your own identifiers and want to cancel them without mapping to KuCoin's order IDs.
}

Choose the method that aligns with how you manage and track your orders in your system.
}

\subsection{Workflow Overview}{
\enumerate{
\item \strong{Parameter Validation}: Ensures \code{orderId} and \code{symbol} are provided and valid.
\item \strong{Request Construction}: Builds the API endpoint with \code{orderId} and \code{symbol} as a query parameter.
\item \strong{Authentication}: Generates headers with API credentials using \code{build_headers()}.
\item \strong{API Request}: Sends a DELETE request to the KuCoin API with a 3-second timeout.
\item \strong{Response Processing}: Parses the response and returns the order ID if successful.
}
}

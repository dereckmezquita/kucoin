\usage{
get_all_currencies_impl(
  base_url = get_base_url(),
  .__coro_env_parent__ = <environment>
)
}
\arguments{
\item{base_url}{A character string representing the base URL for the KuCoin API.
Defaults to the value returned by \code{get_base_url()}.}
}
\value{
A promise that resolves to a \code{data.table} containing combined currency details.
Each row represents a unique currency/chain combination. The data.table includes:

\description{
This asynchronous function retrieves a list of all currencies available on the KuCoin API.
Each currency is returned along with its associated summary details and nested chain-specific details.
For currencies that support multiple chains, the summary information is replicated for each chain,
so that each row in the resulting data.table corresponds to a unique (currency, chain) combination.
If a currency has no associated chain data, dummy chain columns (filled with NA) are appended.
}
\details{
\strong{Workflow Overview:}
\enumerate{
\item \strong{URL Construction:}
Constructs the URL by concatenating the base URL (obtained via \code{get_base_url()})
with the endpoint path \code{/api/v3/currencies}.
\item \strong{HTTP Request:}
Sends a GET request to the constructed URL using \code{httr::GET()} with a 10â€‘second timeout.
\item \strong{Response Processing:}
Processes the response using \code{process_kucoin_response()} to validate the HTTP status and API code,
then extracts the \code{data} field.
\item \strong{Data Conversion:}
Iterates over each row (currency) in the returned data.frame. For each currency, its summary fields are
extracted and its nested \code{chains} data (if available) is converted to a data.table.
\item \strong{Result Assembly:}
If chain data exists, the summary row is replicated for each chain row and combined with the chain data.
Otherwise, dummy chain columns (filled with \code{NA}) are appended.
}

\strong{API Documentation:}
\href{https://www.kucoin.com/docs-new/rest/spot-trading/market-data/get-all-currencies}{KuCoin Get All Currencies}

\strong{Endpoint:} \code{GET https://api.kucoin.com/api/v3/currencies}

This function uses a public endpoint and does not require authentication.

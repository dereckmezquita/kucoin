\title{Get Server Time from KuCoin Futures API}
\usage{
get_server_time(base_url = get_base_url())
}
\arguments{
\item{base_url}{The base URL for the KuCoin Futures API. Defaults to the result of \code{get_base_url()}.}
}
\value{
A promise that resolves to a numeric Unix timestamp in milliseconds.
}
\description{
Retrieves the current API server time (Unix timestamp in milliseconds) from the KuCoin Futures API.
This function performs an asynchronous GET request and returns a promise that either resolves to the
server timestamp or rejects with an error. The server time is a critical component when making
authenticated requests to KuCoin's API. For these requests (e.g., placing orders or fetching account data),
the API requires you to include a timestamp header that is within 5 seconds of the actual server time.
This helps ensure that requests are timely and protects against replay attacks.
}
\details{
The helper function \code{get_base_url()} is used to retrieve the base URL for the Futures domain.
